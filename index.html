"The great idea of constructive type theory is that there is no distinction between programs and proofs&#x2026; Theorems are types (specifications), and proofs are programs"
(Robert Harper)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a sample curriculum if you're interested in undergrad type theory, complexity theory, AI, ect., and you want really good (mostly free) resources to learn these fields so you can follow recent research papers. For reasons why CMU rewrote their curriculum from scratch to be more functional and parallel, see Robert Harper's <a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/intro-curriculum-update/%20">blog</a> and his follow up <a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/the-dog-that-didnt-bark/">post</a> on the success of teaching the new material. You're already familiar with functional programming from basic elementary math. The "functional" part in functional programming refers to mathematical functions, meaning functions where each input has a single output. This property then gives you referential transparency, immutability, and equational reasoning.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
It's possible to gain a remote BSc part-time, if you want combine the theoretical material here with any of the below programs should you wish to later pursue graduate studies. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/programs/cs/">University of The People</a> offers a fully online, US Distance Education Accrediting Commission(DEAC) accredited BSc in Computer Science that is tuition free. You pay an admission fee based on your countries GPA (typically $60), and $100 per exam so ~4k USD for a 4 year degree and they offer financial assistance. They have 5 terms per academic year, with F/T students taking 2 courses per term or P/T students taking 1 course per term. In total there are 11 proctored exams, and you can either ask somebody to be an exam proctor, or use a service like ProctorU, or just look up local universities in your area they often offer this service. Note they currently only have national accreditation, whereas some US graduate programs require regional accreditation. However grads from UoPeople grads have been accepted to foreign campuses since many US universities have <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/global/presence/">multi-country partnerships</a> offering the same accreditation, and the courses are taught in English.  
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a>(OU) in the UK offers Computer Science to students in the UK/EU and select other regions with local testing centers. <a href="https://csc.uis.edu/program-information">University of Illinois</a>, <a href="https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/bachelor-science-software-engineering">Arizona State</a>, <a href="https://ufonline.ufl.edu/degrees/undergraduate/computer-science/">University of Florida</a> offer various accredited remote undergrads. <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/software-development-bachelors-program.html">Western Governor's University</a> computer science program allows you to complete the courses at your own pace, so can finish a degree faster. Besides CS, Open University has some excellent Applied Mathematics degrees, such as the <a href="http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/qualifications/q36">Applied Math w/Statistics</a> BSc(Hons) available to any student worldwide if you want to take mathematics instead, using the material here for your theory of computation interests.

<p>
If you can, buy these books and start building yourself a library. Abe Books often has used copies, or global editions you can buy at significant discount. You will want them around for reference and it also saves your eyes from the strain of screens. If you can't afford these then try libgen.io (Library Genesis) to get a pdf/epub though sometimes the TeX typesetting looks like shit in digital copies. If your country blocks that domain use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis">Wikipedia</a> to find another one.

On Isaac Newton self-learning geometry:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"He bought Descartes' Geometry and read it by himself .. when he was got over 2 or 3 pages he could understand no farther, than he began again and got 3 or 4 pages father till he came to another difficult place, than he began again and advanced farther and continued so doing till he made himself master of the whole without having the least light or instruction from anybody"
 (King's Cam.,Keynes MS 130.10,fol. 2/v/)

over and over until he could comfortably pick randomly through his notes and prove something without assistance. <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/06/the-grandmaster-in-the-corner-office-what-the-study-of-chess-experts-teaches-us-about-building-a-remarkable-life/">Deliberate practice</a> may also be helpful.

The <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">Little Schemer series</a> books are a Q&amp;A format/Socratic method for learning the basics of computation (read the Preface of each book). You can do the Little Schemer with pencil and paper in 3 to 5 sittings. These are great books, that really drill the fundamentals of computation through active learning. The first in the series is <i>The Little Schemer</i> which teaches you recursion. The second is the <i>Seasoned Schemer</i>, a book on higher-order functions which will come in handy when you do the Parallel Algorithms book later. The <i>Reasoned Schemer</i> is a great book for learning relational programming (databases). The <i>Little Prover</i> will drill inductive proofs, excellent for when you take 15-150 Principals of Functional Programming. There is even <i>A Little Java book</i> to teach you the OOP paradigm should you ever find yourself in need to learn Java.

<blockquote>
<p>
 "So I went to Case, and the Dean of Case says to us, it’s a all men’s school, “Men, look at, look to the person on your left, and the person on your right. One of you isn’t going to be here next year; one of you is going to fail.” So I get to Case, and again I’m studying all the time, working really hard on my classes, and so for that I had to be kind of a machine.
 In high school, our math program wasn’t much, and I had never heard of calculus until I got to college. But the calculus book that we had was (in college) was great, and in the back of the book there were supplementary problems that weren’t assigned by the teacher. So this was a famous calculus text by a man named George Thomas (second edition), and I mention it especially because it was one of the first books published by Addison-Wesley, and I loved this calculus book so much that later I chose Addison-Wesley to be the publisher of my own book.
 Our teacher would assign, say, the even numbered problems, or something like that (from the book). I would also do the odd numbered problems. In the back of Thomas’s book he had supplementary problems, the teacher didn’t assign the supplementary problems; I worked the supplementary problems. I was scared I wouldn’t learn calculus, so I worked hard on it, and it turned out that of course it took me longer to solve all these problems than the kids who were only working on what was assigned, at first. 
 But after a year, I could do all of those problems in the same time as my classmates were doing the assigned problems, and after that <i>I could just coast in mathematics, because I’d learned how to solve problems</i>"
(<a href="https://github.com/kragen/knuth-interview-2006">Don Knuth</a> )
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
First, learn math <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/11/14/how-to-ace-calculus-the-art-of-doing-well-in-technical-courses/">intuitively</a>. The <a href="https://betterexplained.com/ebook/math/">Better Explained</a> Math and Calculus book series is excellent at providing this intuition, such as <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-trigonometry/">demystifying</a> trig identities. 
</p>

<p>
After gaining intuition, the best way to fix all your deficiencies in basic math is to jump into a first year calculus text and complete all the exercises. Math, like programming, is learn by doing. If you get stumped, refer to Sheldon Axler's <a href="http://precalculus.axler.net/">Precalculus</a> book as it includes a solutions manual, where exercises are fully worked out instead of just providing an answer, also ask questions/search math.stackexchange.com, or hire a tutor from a local university. One reason why universities dump incoming students into three semesters of calculus is to reteach basic math to new students since they undoubtedly learned it incorrectly in most high schools. Calculus is also worth knowing for it's own sake as the fundamental theorem of calculus is a major breakthrough in terms of cultural importance and heavily used in all engineering disciplines and for finance and AI (stats), probability (integration), optimization (differentiation), estimation, ect.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">
<p>
Most universities, including CMU use the text <i>Calculus: Early Transcendentals</i> by Stewart. I used Thomas' book instead, but it doesn't matter what text you use. This mathematics <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.maths.cam.ac.uk/files/pre2014/undergrad/admissions/readinglist.pdf">reading list</a> from Cambridge University for new undergrads contains other excellent books, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Mathematics">What is Mathematics?</a> by Courant &amp; Robbins, which will also teach you single variable calculus in addition to elementary college algebra. There is also Gilbert Strang's free book <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/index.htm">Calculus</a> and a set of lectures, <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/">Highlights of Calculus</a> to provide more intuition if necessary.

<p>
Doing the many exercises in this text will help to fix all your problems with common trig identities and basic algebra mistakes. This is a great book for building mathematical maturity, as it's possible for somebody with questionable math background to complete, who is motivated to review prior material as they encounter it, though the introduction is a good crash course in most of the math you forgot since high school. At the same time this text is completely thorough, nothing is missed in the exercises and they are gradual in difficulty. If you are tired of calculus but still need to build maturity, meaning you wish to be familiar with definition, theorem, proof style texts you can use Hoffman and Kunze's <i>Linear Algebra</i> book instead. The amount of abstract algebra in their book is minimal, and all the background is provided so that the text is self contained.

"[Computer science] is not really about computers - and it's not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri dishes&#x2026;and geometry isn't really about using surveying instruments. Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use."
